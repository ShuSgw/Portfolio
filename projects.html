                                    I could not change the actual PHP or CSS in the parent theme because if the theme
                                    is updated my code will be deleted.
                                    Therefore, I decided to use a child theme which inherent and overwrite the parent
                                    theme, so my codes are secured.
                                    Another problem was woo-commerce has own syntaxes to customize the order of
                                    elements. Thus, I read the documentation
                                    quickly and figured out all the problems by myself.

                            "Shareable Birthday Card" is a single webpage base application created by
                            HTML, CSS, and
                            Javascript with jQuery platform. All images I used are SVG data and I control them by CSS
                            animation and jQuery.
                            There are three basic interactive functions on this website. Users can control the position
                            of
                            drinks with
                            drag-and-drop. Also, when users tap a balloon, it goes away. Finally, the note illustration
                            is
                            also interactive.
                            When users tap or click it, the jQuery connect to JSON based iTunes database by Ajax which
                            can
                            perform an
                            asynchronous HTTP request. When the Ajax bring the iTunes Date back, JavaScript Audio API
                            receives the information
                            and play music randomly.

                            Pet finder is a website to find images of dogs based on their names from the database made
                            by JSON. Also, I used
                            bootstrap which is a famous CSS framework to style properly. The purpose of the project is
                            to show my skills of Fetch
                            API and Bootstrap. To receiving the images, I used Fetch API which is the newest
                            asynchronous technology to communicate
                            with a server.

                            Let's Chat is a web application that users can post thier messages. Also, it has a login
                            and register system that saves
                            users information. The purpose of the project is to show my skills in HTML, Sass, PHP, and
                            MySQL. Additionally, I use
                            CodeKit which is a GUI application to compile languages that need to be compiled such as
                            Sass.

                            Vision Web is a website for one of assignment from project management class at BCIT. I was
                            the only programmer at the
                            team
                            and creating almost 20 pages website by myself within a week. Skills I used are HTML, Sass,
                            jQuery, node package
                            manager
                            and one of its modules called browsefy. The main purpose is to practice basic web
                            development skills especially to get
                            familier with modern web development tools, such as node package manager.

                        <p class="main__texts">
                            The concept is clickable and legible newsletter. For that concept, I choose flat design and
                            pale colours because more
                            than required 250 words are actually quite many and I need to adjust its design for them.
                            Thus, i thought I should not
                            use skeuomorph design which will be more complicated due to real images that tend to have
                            many different colours and
                            shades. Thus, what I create for this newsletters are all illustrations and flat design
                            based.

                            The purpose of these pictures is to advertise fictional Karaoke event in Vancouver at a
                            beach. I use illustrator and
                            photoshop to design them. All posters are different from each other but they have the same
                            concept which makes people
                            want to join the Karaoke event. When I designed these posters I was considering how people
                            can recognize that these
                            posters are for the Karaoke event at first glace. Then, I decided to use images showing the
                            big mic and shot of a beach
                            in the background. Also, I used hands of various people because I would like to tell people
                            that the event is for
                            everyone comes from any country so that they can choose songs whatever they want to sing,
                            such as songs from their
                            countries.
